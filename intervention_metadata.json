  "intervention_name": "SkeetSteph",
  "intervention_description": "SkeetSteph is a novel GLP-1 receptor agonist administered as a once-weekly subcutaneous injection for chronic weight management. It mimics the incretin hormone GLP-1, promoting satiety, reducing appetite, and slowing gastric emptying to facilitate sustained weight loss.",
  "indication": "Chronic weight management in adults with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²) without type 2 diabetes, as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity",
  "target_population": "Adults aged 30-39 years with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² without type 2 diabetes mellitus, who have not achieved adequate weight loss with diet and exercise alone",
  "special_considerations": "Alopecia (hair loss) has been identified as a notable safety signal in preclinical and/or early clinical observations. This requires dedicated monitoring, grading scales, and reporting throughout the trial. Standard GLP-1 class safety concerns also apply, including gastrointestinal events (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), pancreatitis risk, gallbladder events, and potential thyroid C-cell tumor risk (boxed warning consideration based on rodent studies).",
