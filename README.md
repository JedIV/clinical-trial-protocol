# Clinical Trial Protocol: SkeetSteph (GLP-1 Weight Loss Drug)

Hey Steph — I made this for you. This entire 2,000-line clinical trial protocol was generated by AI in about 15 minutes. I named the drug after us. I typed four things total and it wrote the whole thing. Here's how you can do it too.

## Setup (one time, takes 2 minutes)

You already have Claude, so just open Terminal and run these two commands to install the clinical trial skill:

```bash
claude plugins add-marketplace anthropics/life-sciences
```

```bash
claude plugins install clinical-trial-protocol@life-sciences
```

Done. That's the whole setup.

## Generate a Protocol

**1.** Start Claude:

```bash
claude
```

**2.** Tell it what you want:

```
Create a clinical trial protocol for a new GLP-1 weight loss drug
```

**3.** Pick "Full Protocol" when the menu pops up (type `2`).

**4.** Describe your drug. Here's literally all I typed:

```
SkeetSteph, once-weekly subcutaneous injection, you pick the focus,
lets say people in their 30s with obesity, safety concerns are that
people lose their hair
```

That's it. Four inputs. Claude goes off and researches similar trials (Wegovy, Zepbound, etc.), pulls FDA guidance, calculates sample sizes, and writes the whole protocol — study design, endpoints, statistical plan, safety monitoring, references, everything.

When it's done you get a complete protocol file. You can ask Claude to turn it into a PDF, push it to GitHub, make changes, whatever.

It works for any drug or medical device — just describe what you've got and Claude figures out the rest. The output is a draft (you'd still want a biostatistician and regulatory folks to review), but it's a *really* solid starting point. Pretty cool right?
