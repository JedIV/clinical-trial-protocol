## 1.1 Synopsis

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Title** | A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Phase 3 Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of SkeetSteph, a Once-Weekly Subcutaneous GLP-1 Receptor Agonist, for Chronic Weight Management in Adults with Obesity |
| **Short Title** | SkeetSteph Phase 3 Obesity Trial |
| **Protocol Version and Date** | Version 1.0 Draft, 11-FEB-2026 |
| **Study Description** | This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study evaluating the efficacy and safety of SkeetSteph, a novel GLP-1 receptor agonist administered as a once-weekly subcutaneous injection, for chronic weight management in adults aged 30-39 years with obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m²) without type 2 diabetes mellitus. Participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive SkeetSteph or matching placebo, both as adjuncts to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity program. The study hypothesis is that SkeetSteph will produce statistically significant and clinically meaningful weight reduction compared to placebo over 72 weeks. |
| **Primary Objective** | To evaluate the efficacy of once-weekly subcutaneous SkeetSteph compared to placebo in reducing body weight in adults with obesity |
| **Secondary Objectives** | - To evaluate the proportion of participants achieving clinically meaningful weight loss thresholds (≥5%, ≥10%, ≥15%) - To assess the effect of SkeetSteph on cardiometabolic risk factors (waist circumference, blood pressure, lipids, glycemic parameters) - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of SkeetSteph, with specific focus on alopecia as an adverse event of special interest (AESI) - To assess patient-reported outcomes related to weight-related quality of life |
| **Exploratory Objectives** | - To evaluate the effect of SkeetSteph on body composition (lean mass vs fat mass) via DXA substudy - To explore the relationship between weight loss magnitude and alopecia incidence/severity - To evaluate nutritional biomarkers (ferritin, zinc, biotin, vitamin D) as predictors of alopecia |
| **Primary Endpoint** | Percent change in body weight from baseline to Week 72 |
| **Co-Primary Endpoint** | Proportion of participants achieving ≥5% body weight reduction from baseline at Week 72 |
| **Secondary Endpoints** | - Proportion achieving ≥10% weight reduction at Week 72 - Proportion achieving ≥15% weight reduction at Week 72 - Change in waist circumference from baseline to Week 72 - Change in systolic blood pressure from baseline to Week 72 - Change in fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c from baseline to Week 72 - Change in lipid panel (LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides) from baseline to Week 72 - Incidence and severity of alopecia (graded by CTCAE v5.0 and SALT score) through Week 72 - Change in Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite (IWQOL-Lite) score from baseline to Week 72 |
| **Exploratory Endpoints** | - Change in total body fat mass and lean mass (DXA substudy) at Week 72 - Correlation between rate of weight loss and alopecia onset/severity - Change in nutritional biomarkers (ferritin, zinc, biotin, vitamin D) over time - Change in Hairdex questionnaire score from baseline to Week 72 |
| **Study Population** | N=4,500 (3,000 SkeetSteph : 1,500 placebo). Adults aged 30-39 years with BMI ≥30 kg/m² without type 2 diabetes mellitus who have not achieved adequate weight loss with diet and exercise alone. Key exclusions: type 1 or 2 diabetes, prior bariatric surgery, history of pancreatitis, MTC/MEN2 history, active alopecia areata. |
| **Phase** | Phase 3 |
| **Description of Sites** | Multicenter study conducted at approximately 150-200 clinical sites across the United States, Canada, and Europe. Sites will include academic medical centers, community-based clinical research sites, and endocrinology/obesity specialty clinics. |
| **Description of Study Intervention** | SkeetSteph: Once-weekly subcutaneous injection, dose-escalation over 20 weeks to target maintenance dose, administered in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm. Placebo: Matching once-weekly subcutaneous injection (volume-matched, visually identical). Both arms: Standardized lifestyle intervention including reduced-calorie diet (500 kcal/day deficit) and increased physical activity (≥150 min/week moderate-intensity) with monthly dietitian counseling. |
| **Study Duration** | Enrollment period: ~18 months. Treatment period: 72 weeks (20-week dose escalation + 52-week maintenance). Follow-up period: 8 weeks post-treatment. Total study duration: ~30 months. |
| **Participant Duration** | Screening: Up to 28 days. Treatment: 72 weeks. Follow-up: 8 weeks. Total participation: ~82 weeks (~19 months). |

# 2 INTRODUCTION

## 2.1 Study Rationale

Obesity is a chronic, relapsing, multifactorial disease characterized by abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health. Globally, obesity prevalence has nearly tripled since 1975, with the World Health Organization estimating that over 890 million adults were living with obesity in 2022. In the United States, the prevalence of obesity among adults aged 20 and over exceeds 42%, with the highest rates of increase observed in younger adults aged 25-44 years. Obesity is independently associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obstructive sleep apnea, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, certain cancers, and all-cause mortality. The economic burden is substantial, with obesity-related medical costs estimated at over $170 billion annually in the US alone.

Current pharmacological options for chronic weight management, while transformative compared to earlier agents, leave significant unmet needs. Approved GLP-1 receptor agonists (semaglutide, liraglutide) and the dual GIP/GLP-1 agonist tirzepatide have demonstrated 15-22% mean body weight reductions in Phase 3 trials. However, individual response varies considerably, gastrointestinal tolerability remains a barrier to optimal dosing for many patients, and long-term data beyond 2-3 years remains limited. Additionally, the emergence of alopecia as a safety signal across the GLP-1 class — with over 1,000 reports in the FDA FAERS database — highlights the need for agents with improved safety profiles and for clinical programs that prospectively characterize hair loss risk.

SkeetSteph is a novel GLP-1 receptor agonist designed to address these unmet needs. Preclinical and early clinical data suggest a favorable efficacy-to-tolerability ratio with once-weekly subcutaneous dosing. This Phase 3 study is designed to confirm the efficacy and safety of SkeetSteph for chronic weight management while prospectively characterizing the incidence, severity, and natural history of alopecia — a first for a GLP-1 weight management pivotal program. The study design aligns with the FDA's January 2025 draft guidance on developing drugs for weight reduction, incorporating updated endpoints, estimand frameworks, and sample size requirements.

Results from this study will inform an NDA submission for chronic weight management and contribute novel safety data on the relationship between GLP-1-mediated weight loss and hair loss, informing clinical risk-benefit discussions and future product labeling.

## 2.2 Background

### A. Disease/Condition Overview

Obesity is defined by the World Health Organization as a body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m² and is classified into three classes: Class 1 (BMI 30-34.9), Class 2 (BMI 35-39.9), and Class 3 (BMI ≥40). The underlying pathophysiology involves a complex interplay of genetic susceptibility, neurohormonal signaling (including the incretin system, leptin resistance, and hypothalamic appetite regulation), environmental factors (caloric excess, sedentary behavior), and epigenetic modifications. Adipose tissue dysfunction leads to chronic low-grade inflammation, insulin resistance, and metabolic dysregulation that drives comorbid disease development.

The natural history of obesity is characterized by progressive weight gain with periods of partial weight loss followed by regain. Without intervention, patients with obesity face a relentless trajectory toward metabolic and cardiovascular complications. The disease course is influenced by age of onset, severity, duration, fat distribution (visceral vs subcutaneous), and the presence and severity of comorbidities.

Epidemiologically, obesity disproportionately affects younger adults in the US, with prevalence in the 20-39 age group reaching approximately 40%. This population faces decades of exposure to obesity-related risks and represents a critical target for early intervention. Risk factors include genetic predisposition, sedentary lifestyle, high-calorie diet, sleep disruption, stress, certain medications (antipsychotics, corticosteroids, some antidepressants), and socioeconomic factors limiting access to healthy food and physical activity.

The disease burden of obesity extends beyond mortality to encompass significant morbidity: reduced quality of life, functional impairment, psychological distress (depression, anxiety, weight stigma), reduced productivity, and healthcare utilization. Adults with obesity have medical costs approximately 30% higher than those with normal weight.

Diagnosis is established by BMI calculation, supplemented by waist circumference measurement (≥102 cm in men, ≥88 cm in women indicating central obesity), assessment of comorbidities, and evaluation of secondary causes (hypothyroidism, Cushing syndrome, medications).

### B. Current Standard of Care

First-line management of obesity consists of comprehensive lifestyle intervention including dietary modification (500-750 kcal/day energy deficit), increased physical activity (≥150 minutes/week moderate-intensity aerobic activity), and behavioral counseling. Lifestyle intervention alone typically achieves 3-5% weight loss, which while clinically meaningful, is insufficient for many patients.

Pharmacotherapy is recommended as adjunctive to lifestyle intervention for adults with BMI ≥30 or BMI ≥27 with weight-related comorbidities who have not achieved sufficient weight loss with lifestyle changes alone. Currently approved agents for chronic weight management include:

- **Semaglutide 2.4 mg SC weekly (Wegovy):** Approved 2021. The STEP 1 trial (NCT03548935, N=1,961) demonstrated 14.9% mean weight loss vs 2.4% placebo over 68 weeks. Approved in 2025 as oral formulation (25 mg daily) based on OASIS 4 trial (NCT05564117). Common AEs: nausea (44%), diarrhea (30%), vomiting (24%).

- **Tirzepatide SC weekly (Zepbound):** Dual GIP/GLP-1 agonist approved 2023. SURMOUNT-1 (NCT04184622, N=2,539) showed 15.0-20.9% mean weight loss across doses (5/10/15 mg) vs 3.1% placebo over 72 weeks. Similar GI AE profile.

- **Liraglutide 3.0 mg SC daily (Saxenda):** Approved 2014. Demonstrated ~8% weight loss. Generic now available (Teva).

- **Orlistat, phentermine/topiramate, naltrexone/bupropion:** Older agents with more modest efficacy (5-10% weight loss) and varying tolerability profiles.

Bariatric surgery remains the most effective intervention for severe obesity (BMI ≥40 or ≥35 with comorbidities) with 20-35% sustained weight loss, but is limited by surgical risk, irreversibility, access barriers, and patient acceptance.

Limitations of current pharmacotherapy include: variable individual response (10-30% of patients are non-responders), GI tolerability as a dose-limiting factor, high cost, need for chronic administration, incomplete understanding of long-term safety, and the emerging alopecia safety signal across the GLP-1 class.

### C. Drug Background

#### C1. Drug Description

**Generic Name:** SkeetSteph (investigational)
**Drug Class:** Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist
**Molecular Category:** [TBD - peptide analog or small molecule]
**Formulation:** Sterile, clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to slightly yellow solution for subcutaneous injection
**Dosage Form:** Pre-filled single-dose pen for subcutaneous injection
**Strengths:** [TBD - multiple dose strengths for dose escalation, e.g., 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, 1.7 mg, 2.4 mg]
**Route of Administration:** Subcutaneous injection (abdomen, thigh, or upper arm)
**Frequency:** Once weekly

#### C2. Mechanism of Action

SkeetSteph is an agonist of the GLP-1 receptor, a G-protein-coupled receptor expressed in pancreatic beta cells, the gastrointestinal tract, the central nervous system (hypothalamus, brainstem), and other tissues. By binding to and activating the GLP-1 receptor, SkeetSteph mimics the physiological effects of endogenous GLP-1, an incretin hormone secreted by intestinal L-cells in response to nutrient intake.

The weight loss mechanism of GLP-1 receptor agonism operates through multiple complementary pathways:

1. **Central appetite regulation:** GLP-1 receptor activation in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus and paraventricular nucleus suppresses orexigenic (appetite-stimulating) neuropeptide Y/agouti-related peptide (NPY/AgRP) signaling and enhances anorexigenic (appetite-suppressing) proopiomelanocortin (POMC) signaling, reducing hunger and increasing satiety.

2. **Brainstem signaling:** Activation of GLP-1 receptors in the nucleus tractus solitarius and area postrema mediates satiety signals and contributes to reduced food intake and potential nausea (which also limits intake).

3. **Delayed gastric emptying:** GLP-1 receptor activation slows gastric motility, promoting prolonged gastric distension and early satiety after meals.

4. **Glucose-dependent insulin secretion:** Enhanced insulin secretion in the postprandial state improves glycemic control and may contribute to metabolic improvements independent of weight loss.

5. **Glucagon suppression:** Reduced glucagon secretion contributes to improved hepatic glucose output and metabolic profile.

These mechanisms are directly relevant to obesity pathophysiology, targeting the neurohormonal dysregulation that drives excessive caloric intake and metabolic dysfunction in patients with obesity.

#### C3. Pharmacology

**Pharmacokinetics (Projected based on GLP-1 RA class and preclinical data):**

- **Absorption:** Following subcutaneous injection, SkeetSteph is slowly absorbed from the injection site, achieving peak plasma concentration (Tmax) at approximately [TBD] hours post-dose. Absolute bioavailability following SC injection is estimated at [TBD]%. The slow absorption supports once-weekly dosing.
- **Distribution:** Volume of distribution (Vd) estimated at [TBD] L. Plasma protein binding is approximately [TBD]%. SkeetSteph crosses the blood-brain barrier to access central GLP-1 receptors, which is critical for appetite-suppressing effects.
- **Metabolism:** SkeetSteph is metabolized through general proteolytic degradation pathways. It is not primarily metabolized by CYP450 enzymes, reducing potential for drug-drug interactions. No active metabolites have been identified.
- **Excretion:** Terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) is approximately [TBD] hours, supporting once-weekly dosing. Elimination is primarily through peptide degradation with renal and fecal excretion of metabolites.

**Pharmacodynamics:**

- **Dose-response:** Preclinical studies demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction in food intake and body weight in diet-induced obese rodent models, with a plateau at doses corresponding to approximately [TBD] mg human equivalent dose.
- **Time course:** Weight loss onset expected within 4-8 weeks, with progressive weight loss through 52-72 weeks of treatment, consistent with the GLP-1 RA class.
- **Target engagement:** Receptor occupancy studies indicate [TBD]% GLP-1 receptor occupancy at projected therapeutic doses.

#### C4. Nonclinical Studies

**Preclinical Efficacy:**

- In vitro binding studies demonstrated high-affinity GLP-1 receptor binding with [TBD] nM EC50 in cAMP assay.
- Diet-induced obese (DIO) mouse model: [TBD]% body weight reduction over 8 weeks at human-equivalent therapeutic dose.
- DIO rat model: [TBD]% weight reduction with improvements in glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and hepatic steatosis.
- Dose-response characterization across multiple animal models established therapeutic window and maximum effective dose.

**Preclinical Safety/Toxicology:**

- **Acute toxicity:** Single-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs established no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) at [TBD] mg/kg (approximately [TBD]x human dose on mg/m² basis).
- **Chronic toxicity:** 26-week repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs. Key findings consistent with GLP-1 RA class: dose-dependent weight loss, reduced food intake, gastrointestinal effects. NOAEL at [TBD] mg/kg.
- **Carcinogenicity:** 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats revealed thyroid C-cell tumors (follicular cell adenomas and carcinomas) at doses ≥[TBD]x human dose, consistent with the GLP-1 RA drug class. This finding is attributed to sustained GLP-1 receptor activation in rodent thyroid C-cells and its clinical relevance to humans is uncertain. Carcinogenicity study in mice: [TBD].
- **Genotoxicity:** Negative in standard battery (Ames test, in vitro chromosomal aberration, in vivo micronucleus).
- **Reproductive toxicity:** Embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits showed [TBD]. SkeetSteph is contraindicated in pregnancy. Males: no effect on fertility parameters at doses up to [TBD]x human dose.
- **Hair follicle observations:** [TBD - preclinical observations regarding hair/fur changes, if any, in chronic toxicity studies would be documented here. This is particularly relevant given the clinical alopecia signal.]

**Translation to Humans:**

- Human equivalent dose (HED) calculated from NOAEL using body surface area conversion.
- Starting dose for Phase 1 selected at [TBD] mg based on 1/10th of HED, consistent with ICH S9 guidance.
- Dose escalation strategy designed to optimize tolerability while achieving therapeutic exposure.

#### C5. Prior Clinical Experience

**Phase 1 Studies:**

- [TBD - First-in-human, single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) studies establishing safety, tolerability, PK, and preliminary PD in healthy volunteers and patients with obesity. Include NCT numbers when available.]
- Safety profile: [TBD - GI events (nausea, vomiting) consistent with class; any hair-related observations]
- PK/PD: Dose-proportional exposure; half-life supporting QW dosing confirmed.

**Phase 2 Studies:**

- [TBD - Dose-finding study establishing recommended Phase 3 dose. Include NCT number, N, design, key efficacy and safety results. Expected to show dose-dependent weight loss with identification of optimal efficacy:tolerability ratio.]
- Recommended Phase 3 dose: [TBD] mg SC QW based on Phase 2 efficacy, safety, and PK/PD data.
- Alopecia observations in Phase 2: [TBD - any hair loss events observed, incidence, severity, reversibility]

### D. Rationale for Current Study Intervention

SkeetSteph is expected to produce clinically meaningful weight loss in adults with obesity based on the well-established efficacy of GLP-1 receptor agonism for weight management. The biological plausibility is firmly established: GLP-1 receptor activation reduces appetite, slows gastric emptying, and modulates central energy homeostasis — mechanisms validated by the clinical success of semaglutide (14.9% weight loss, STEP 1), tirzepatide (15.0-20.9%, SURMOUNT-1), and other GLP-1 RAs.

SkeetSteph may differentiate from existing GLP-1 RAs through [TBD - potential differentiating features such as improved tolerability, enhanced efficacy, novel receptor binding properties, or favorable safety profile]. This trial is specifically designed to address the alopecia safety signal prospectively, which has been retrospectively identified across the class but never systematically characterized in a pivotal trial.

The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design is the gold standard for demonstrating efficacy in chronic weight management and is required by FDA guidance. A 72-week treatment duration (including 20-week dose escalation) is consistent with all major recent GLP-1 RA weight management programs (STEP, SURMOUNT, ATTAIN) and meets the 2025 FDA guidance requirement for ≥1 year of maintenance treatment. Placebo plus lifestyle intervention as the comparator is standard and ethically appropriate, as there is no single established standard of care for pharmacological weight management.

### E. Similar Clinical Trials and Lessons Learned

The following pivotal trials directly inform the design of this study:

1. **STEP 1 (NCT03548935):** Semaglutide 2.4 mg, N=1,961, 68 weeks, 14.9% weight loss. *Lessons:* Established co-primary endpoints (% change + ≥5% responder). 2:1 randomization is feasible. GI AEs peak during escalation and attenuate. Lifestyle intervention in both arms is essential.

2. **SURMOUNT-1 (NCT04184622):** Tirzepatide, N=2,539, 72 weeks, 15-21% weight loss. *Lessons:* Multi-dose arms can differentiate dose-response. 20-week escalation improves GI tolerability. Stratification by sex, BMI, and glycemic status improves balance. Large sample sizes are feasible across multinational sites.

3. **ATTAIN-1 (NCT05869903):** Orforglipron, N=3,127, 72 weeks. *Lessons:* Sample sizes approaching FDA 2025 guidance (≥3,000 on drug) are achievable. Newer GLP-1 RAs may show different efficacy ranges (7.5-11.2% in this case). Oral formulations are viable competitors.

4. **STEP UP (NCT05646706):** Semaglutide 7.2 mg, N=1,407, 72 weeks. *Lessons:* Higher doses can achieve greater weight loss. Dose-response relationship within GLP-1 RA class persists at higher doses.

**Key design improvements in SkeetSteph trial:**
- Prospective alopecia characterization (AESI with standardized grading, photography, PROs) — novel for the class
- Nutritional biomarker monitoring (ferritin, zinc, biotin, vitamin D) to elucidate alopecia mechanism
- Sample size of 4,500 aligned with 2025 FDA guidance requirements
- Updated statistical approach using estimand framework and multiple imputation per 2025 FDA guidance
- DXA body composition substudy to assess lean mass preservation

## 2.3 Risk/Benefit Assessment

### 2.3.1 Known Potential Risks

**Immediate Risks (occurring during or shortly after treatment initiation):**

1. **Gastrointestinal events (Very common, >10%):** Nausea (40-44%), vomiting (15-24%), diarrhea (20-30%), constipation (10-24%), abdominal pain (10-20%), dyspepsia (5-10%). These are the most common AEs across the GLP-1 RA class, typically mild to moderate (Grade 1-2), occur predominantly during dose escalation, and frequently attenuate with continued treatment. Based on STEP and SURMOUNT programs, GI events lead to treatment discontinuation in 4-7% of participants.

2. **Injection site reactions (Common, 1-10%):** Pain, erythema, pruritus, swelling at the injection site. Generally mild and transient.

3. **Alopecia/Hair loss (Uncommon to Common, 1-10% estimated):** Telogen effluvium is the most likely mechanism, triggered by the metabolic stress of rapid weight loss and potential nutritional deficiencies. FDA FAERS data show elevated reporting for semaglutide (ROR 2.46) and tirzepatide (ROR 1.73). Hair loss may be diffuse, progressive, and distressing to participants. This is a key Adverse Event of Special Interest (AESI) in this study.

4. **Hypoglycemia (Uncommon, <5% in non-diabetic population):** GLP-1 RA-mediated insulin secretion is glucose-dependent, minimizing hypoglycemia risk in non-diabetic patients. Risk increases if combined with sulfonylureas or insulin (excluded in this population).

5. **Headache, dizziness, fatigue (Common, 5-15%):** Generally mild and self-limiting.

6. **Increased heart rate (Common, 1-5 bpm increase):** Dose-dependent, mechanism not fully understood, generally not clinically significant.

7. **Risks from study procedures:** Blood draws (bruising, discomfort), DXA scan (minimal radiation exposure in substudy), psychological impact of regular weight monitoring.

**Long-Range Risks:**

1. **Pancreatitis:** Acute pancreatitis has been reported with GLP-1 RAs at rates of approximately 0.1-0.3%. The causal relationship remains debated but requires monitoring (amylase/lipase at each visit).

2. **Gallbladder events:** Cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, and biliary events occur at increased rates (1.5-2.5%) with GLP-1 RAs, likely related to rapid weight loss altering bile composition.

3. **Thyroid C-cell tumors:** GLP-1 RAs cause thyroid C-cell tumors in rodents (class effect). Clinical relevance in humans is uncertain, but a boxed warning applies to all GLP-1 RAs. Baseline and periodic calcitonin monitoring included.

4. **Renal impairment:** Dehydration from GI events (vomiting, diarrhea) may exacerbate renal insufficiency. Renal function monitored throughout.

5. **Suicidal ideation/behavior:** FDA has evaluated reports of suicidal ideation with GLP-1 RAs; no definitive causal link established, but C-SSRS monitoring included as a precaution.

6. **Unknown long-term risks:** As a novel compound, long-term safety beyond the study duration cannot be fully characterized. This is an inherent limitation of all investigational drug studies.

### 2.3.2 Known Potential Benefits

**Immediate Potential Benefits:**

1. **Clinically meaningful weight loss:** Based on the GLP-1 RA class, participants randomized to SkeetSteph may achieve 10-20% weight reduction from baseline, exceeding what is achievable with lifestyle intervention alone (2-5%). Weight loss of ≥5% is associated with improvements in obesity-related comorbidities.

2. **Cardiometabolic improvements:** Weight loss with GLP-1 RAs is associated with reductions in blood pressure, improvements in lipid profile (reduced LDL-C and triglycerides, increased HDL-C), improved glycemic control (reduced fasting glucose, HbA1c), and reduced risk of progression to type 2 diabetes in patients with prediabetes.

3. **Improved quality of life:** Weight loss is associated with improvements in physical functioning, mobility, self-esteem, body image, and social participation. Patient-reported outcome improvements documented across GLP-1 RA trials.

4. **Close medical monitoring:** Study participants benefit from regular medical assessments, laboratory monitoring, dietitian counseling, and clinical oversight that may not be available in routine clinical care.

**Important:** No guarantee of benefit. Participants may be randomized to placebo. Individual responses to GLP-1 RAs vary, and some participants may not achieve clinically meaningful weight loss.

**Long-Range Potential Benefits:**

1. **Sustained weight management:** If efficacy is maintained, long-term weight reduction may reduce lifetime risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular events, certain cancers, and all-cause mortality.

2. **Reduced need for more invasive interventions:** Effective pharmacotherapy may reduce the need for bariatric surgery in some patients.

3. **Contribution to generalizable knowledge:** Data generated will inform the understanding of GLP-1 RA efficacy, safety (particularly alopecia), and optimal use for weight management, benefiting future patients.

### 2.3.3 Assessment of Potential Risks and Benefits

**Risk-Benefit Balance:**

The anticipated risks of SkeetSteph are consistent with the well-characterized safety profile of the GLP-1 RA class. The most common risks (GI events) are generally mild to moderate, manageable with dose escalation, and self-limiting. The more serious potential risks (pancreatitis, gallbladder events, thyroid C-cell concern) are uncommon and are mitigated by careful participant selection (exclusion criteria) and monitoring (amylase/lipase, calcitonin).

Alopecia, while distressing, is generally non-life-threatening and potentially reversible. The prospective characterization of this risk in the current study represents a significant advance over prior programs that reported it only retrospectively. Detailed monitoring will enable informed risk-benefit discussions for prescribers and patients.

The potential benefits — meaningful weight reduction with associated cardiometabolic improvements — are well-established for the GLP-1 RA class and address a serious chronic disease with limited treatment options. The risks of untreated obesity (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, mortality) substantially outweigh the known risks of GLP-1 RA therapy. The 2:1 randomization ratio maximizes the number of participants receiving active treatment while maintaining adequate placebo exposure for statistical rigor.

**Risk Minimization Strategies:**

1. **Patient selection:** Stringent eligibility criteria exclude participants at elevated risk (pancreatitis history, MTC/MEN2, active alopecia areata, severe renal impairment, suicidal ideation).
2. **Dose escalation:** 20-week escalation mitigates GI AE severity by allowing physiologic adaptation.
3. **Frequent monitoring:** Schedule of Activities includes regular safety assessments (amylase/lipase, calcitonin, C-SSRS, hair assessments, nutritional biomarkers) at defined intervals.
4. **Stopping rules:** Prespecified discontinuation criteria for individual participants (severe pancreatitis, clinically significant calcitonin elevation, severe alopecia per protocol-defined thresholds) and study-wide stopping rules per DSMB charter.
5. **DSMB oversight:** Independent Data Safety Monitoring Board will conduct regular safety reviews with predefined futility and harm boundaries.
6. **Informed consent:** Comprehensive consent process including detailed discussion of alopecia risk, class-specific risks, and participant rights.
7. **Training:** All site staff trained in AE recognition, grading, and reporting, with specific training on alopecia assessment.

# 4 STUDY DESIGN

## 4.1 Overall Design

This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of SkeetSteph administered as a once-weekly subcutaneous injection for chronic weight management in adults aged 30-39 years with obesity.

**Key Design Features:**

- **Study Type:** Interventional clinical trial
- **Phase:** Phase 3 (pivotal)
- **Design:** Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group
- **Blinding:** Double-blind (participants, investigators, site staff, sponsor study team, and outcome assessors are blinded to treatment assignment). An unblinded pharmacist or designee at each site will manage study drug dispensing.
- **Randomization:** 2:1 (SkeetSteph : Placebo) using an interactive web response system (IWRS). Stratified by BMI category (30-34.9 vs 35-39.9 vs ≥40 kg/m²), sex (male vs female), race/ethnicity, and glycemic status (normoglycemia vs prediabetes, defined as HbA1c 5.7-6.4% or FPG 100-125 mg/dL).
- **Study Arms:**
  - **Arm A (SkeetSteph):** SkeetSteph SC QW with 20-week dose escalation to target maintenance dose + lifestyle intervention. N=3,000.
  - **Arm B (Placebo):** Matching placebo SC QW + lifestyle intervention. N=1,500.
- **Number of Sites:** Approximately 150-200 clinical sites
- **Geographic Distribution:** United States (~60% of sites), Canada (~15%), Europe (~25%)
- **Study Duration:**
  - Enrollment period: ~18 months
  - Treatment period: 72 weeks (20-week dose escalation + 52-week maintenance)
  - Post-treatment follow-up: 8 weeks
  - Total study duration from first participant enrolled to last participant last visit: ~30 months
- **Target Enrollment:** N=4,500 (3,000 SkeetSteph : 1,500 Placebo)

**Study Periods:**

1. **Screening (Day -28 to Day -1):** Eligibility assessment, informed consent, baseline assessments, medical history, laboratory evaluations.
2. **Dose Escalation Period (Weeks 1-20):** Gradual dose increase to minimize GI side effects. Dose increments every 4 weeks per protocol-specified escalation schedule.
3. **Maintenance Period (Weeks 21-72):** Treatment at target maintenance dose with regular efficacy and safety assessments.
4. **Post-Treatment Follow-up (Weeks 73-80):** Safety follow-up after last dose, including alopecia assessment for recovery.

## 4.2 Scientific Rationale for Study Design

**Randomized controlled trial (RCT):** A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design is the gold standard for demonstrating efficacy in chronic weight management, is required by the FDA 2025 draft guidance, and is consistent with all pivotal GLP-1 RA weight management programs (STEP, SURMOUNT, ATTAIN, OASIS). Randomization and blinding minimize selection bias, confounding, and placebo effects, which are particularly relevant for subjective endpoints and self-reported outcomes.

**Placebo comparator:** Placebo (with lifestyle intervention in both arms) is the appropriate comparator for several reasons: (1) there is no single established standard-of-care pharmacotherapy for obesity; (2) placebo-controlled design is mandated by FDA guidance for weight management drugs; (3) the effect size of lifestyle intervention alone provides a clinically relevant control; (4) active comparator trials (e.g., head-to-head vs semaglutide) may be appropriate for subsequent studies but are not required for initial approval.

**2:1 randomization ratio:** Selected to maximize the number of participants exposed to SkeetSteph, meeting the FDA 2025 guidance requirement of ≥3,000 subjects on the investigational drug while limiting total enrollment. This ratio is ethically favorable (greater chance of receiving active treatment) and improves safety database characterization with modest loss of statistical power.

**Double-blind design:** Essential for weight management trials because body weight measurement can be influenced by participant behavior (diet adherence, exercise) and subjective outcomes (PROs, AE reporting) may be affected by knowledge of treatment assignment. Matching placebo injections ensure blinding integrity.

**72-week treatment duration:** Selected to provide a 20-week dose escalation period (consistent with SURMOUNT-1 and optimal for GI tolerability) plus a 52-week maintenance period, meeting the FDA 2025 guidance requirement of ≥1 year maintenance treatment. The 72-week total is consistent with SURMOUNT-1 and ATTAIN-1 trial durations.

**8-week post-treatment follow-up:** Provides safety data on treatment discontinuation effects (weight regain trajectory, AE resolution including alopecia recovery assessment) and contributes to understanding the durability of treatment effects.

## 4.3 Justification for Dose

The SkeetSteph dose for this Phase 3 trial was selected based on the totality of nonclinical and clinical data:

**Nonclinical dose rationale:**
- Preclinical efficacy studies in DIO rodent models demonstrated dose-dependent body weight reduction, with maximum efficacy plateau at approximately [TBD] mg/kg (corresponding to approximately [TBD] mg human equivalent dose).
- Chronic toxicology studies established the NOAEL at [TBD] mg/kg in rats and [TBD] mg/kg in dogs, providing a safety margin of approximately [TBD]-fold over the proposed clinical dose.

**Clinical dose rationale:**
- Phase 1 SAD/MAD studies established safety and tolerability across the [TBD] mg dose range, with dose-limiting GI events at [TBD] mg.
- Phase 2 dose-finding study evaluated [TBD] doses of SkeetSteph over [TBD] weeks in [TBD] participants with obesity. The [TBD] mg dose demonstrated the optimal efficacy-to-tolerability ratio, achieving [TBD]% mean body weight loss with acceptable GI AE rates of [TBD]%.
- PK/PD modeling confirmed that the recommended dose achieves [TBD]% receptor occupancy throughout the dosing interval, consistent with the exposure-response relationship.

**Dose escalation rationale:**
- A 20-week dose escalation schedule (dose increments every 4 weeks) is employed to minimize GI tolerability issues during treatment initiation. This approach is consistent with semaglutide (Wegovy) and tirzepatide (Zepbound) approved dose escalation schedules and reflects the GLP-1 RA class experience that gradual dose titration significantly reduces nausea, vomiting, and treatment discontinuation.

**Route and frequency rationale:**
- Once-weekly subcutaneous injection was selected to maximize adherence (reduced injection frequency) while maintaining sustained therapeutic drug levels throughout the dosing interval. This frequency is established for the GLP-1 RA class (semaglutide QW, tirzepatide QW) and preferred by patients over daily injections.

## 4.4 End of Study Definition

**Individual participant completion:** A participant is considered to have completed the study upon completion of the Week 80 (end-of-study) follow-up visit, including all required assessments. A participant is considered to have completed the treatment period upon completion of the Week 72 visit.

**Global study end:** The study will be considered complete when the last randomized participant has completed the last study visit (Week 80), all data queries have been resolved, the database is locked, and the final clinical study report is issued.

**Early termination criteria for the study:**
- The DSMB recommends termination based on prespecified safety stopping boundaries (unacceptable rate of SAEs, unexpected safety signal, or unacceptable risk-benefit ratio)
- Futility analysis at interim demonstrates no reasonable probability of achieving primary endpoint
- Sponsor decision based on regulatory action, business considerations, or external data rendering the study no longer necessary or feasible
- Regulatory authority (FDA or other) mandates study discontinuation

In the event of early termination, all enrolled participants will be offered a final safety visit and appropriate transition of care.

## 5.3 Lifestyle Considerations

All participants (both SkeetSteph and placebo arms) will participate in a standardized lifestyle modification program for the duration of the study:

**Dietary Intervention:**
- Reduced-calorie diet targeting approximately 500 kcal/day deficit from estimated total daily energy expenditure (calculated using Mifflin-St Jeor equation adjusted for activity level)
- General dietary composition guidance: emphasis on whole foods, fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, limited processed foods and added sugars
- No specific macronutrient ratio mandated (to reflect real-world primary care setting per FDA guidance)
- Monthly counseling sessions with a registered dietitian (in-person or telehealth)

**Physical Activity Intervention:**
- Target: ≥150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity (e.g., brisk walking, cycling, swimming)
- Gradual progression for sedentary participants (start at 75 min/week, increase by 25 min/week)
- Physical activity logged using participant diary and reviewed at each study visit
- Resistance/strength training encouraged but not mandated

**Contraception:**
- WOCBP and male participants with WOCBP partners must use highly effective contraception as specified in Inclusion Criteria 8-9
- Pregnancy testing at scheduled visits as specified in the SoA

**Nutritional supplementation:**
- Participants found to have nutritional deficiencies (ferritin <30 ng/mL, zinc <60 mcg/dL, vitamin D <20 ng/mL) at any study visit will be referred to their primary care provider for supplementation per standard of care. Supplementation is permitted and will be documented as a concomitant medication.

**Alcohol and substance use:**
- Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted (≤1 drink/day for women, ≤2 drinks/day for men)
- Tobacco cessation is encouraged but not required; changes in tobacco use will be documented

## 5.4 Screen Failures

A screen failure is defined as a participant who provides informed consent and undergoes screening assessments but is determined to be ineligible for randomization based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria.

- All screen failures will be documented with the primary reason for screen failure in the screening log
- Screen failure rates are expected at approximately 20-25% based on similar GLP-1 RA trials
- Re-screening is permitted once, after a minimum washout of 30 days, only if the initial screen failure reason was for a potentially correctable condition (e.g., elevated liver enzymes, uncontrolled blood pressure). Re-screening requires new informed consent.
- Screen failures will not be assigned a randomization number
- Screen failure data will be retained in the study database for regulatory reporting purposes

## 5.5 Strategies for Recruitment and Retention

**Recruitment Methods:**
- Identification of potentially eligible participants from investigator patient panels and referral networks
- Electronic health record (EHR) screening at participating sites
- Physician referral from endocrinology, primary care, and obesity medicine clinics
- IRB-approved advertisements (print, digital, social media) targeting the 30-39 age demographic
- Community outreach through health fairs, employer wellness programs, and community health centers
- Partnership with obesity advocacy organizations
- ClinicalTrials.gov posting per regulatory requirements

**Diversity and Inclusion:**
- Recruitment strategies will ensure enrollment reflective of the demographic composition of the target population per FDA Diversity Action Plan requirements
- Sites selected to include geographic and socioeconomic diversity
- Materials provided in English and Spanish (additional languages per site needs)
- Enrollment monitoring by race/ethnicity, sex, and BMI class with targeted recruitment if underrepresentation is identified

**Retention Strategies:**
- Flexible scheduling (including evening and weekend appointments where possible)
- Telehealth options for dietitian counseling and non-laboratory visits
- Reminder systems (automated calls, texts, emails) for upcoming visits
- Reimbursement for study-related travel and time (per IRB-approved amounts, not coercive)
- Participant appreciation communications and study newsletters
- Consistent study coordinator contact (dedicated point of contact per participant)
- Prompt response to participant questions and concerns
- Clear communication about study duration and expectations during informed consent

**Enrollment Targets:**
- Target enrollment of 4,500 participants over approximately 18 months
- Average enrollment rate: ~250 participants/month across all sites
- Average per-site enrollment: 23-30 participants per site over the enrollment period
- Enrollment dashboards monitored weekly by the sponsor with site-level follow-up for underperforming sites

- Injections are administered on the same day each week, at any time of day, with or without meals
- If a dose is missed, it should be administered as soon as possible within 5 days of the scheduled day. If more than 5 days have elapsed, the missed dose should be skipped and the next dose administered on the regularly scheduled day.
- Participants will be trained on self-injection technique at the baseline visit using training pens, and proficiency will be confirmed before first dose administration

**Dose Modification:**
- If a participant does not tolerate a dose escalation step (persistent Grade ≥2 GI AEs for >2 weeks despite supportive management), the dose may be reduced to the previous tolerated level. One re-escalation attempt is permitted after ≥4 weeks at the reduced dose.
- Participants unable to escalate to the target maintenance dose may continue on the highest tolerated dose. These participants will remain in the study and be analyzed per the ITT population.

## 6.2 Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability

### 6.2.1 Acquisition and Accountability

Study drug (SkeetSteph and matching placebo) will be manufactured by [TBD - sponsor or CMO] and supplied to study sites by the sponsor. Drug accountability logs will be maintained at each site documenting receipt, dispensation, return, and destruction of all study drug. The investigator or designee is responsible for study drug accountability and must ensure that study drug is used only in accordance with this protocol. Unused study drug must be returned to the sponsor or destroyed per site-specific procedures.

### 6.2.2 Formulation, Appearance, Packaging, and Labeling

SkeetSteph is formulated as a sterile, clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to slightly yellow aqueous solution for subcutaneous injection in a pre-filled single-dose pen. Matching placebo pens are visually identical in appearance, packaging, and labeling (other than the blinded treatment code). All study drug is labeled in accordance with 21 CFR 312.6 and applicable local regulations, including protocol number, batch number, storage conditions, expiration date, "For Clinical Trial Use Only" statement, and sponsor contact information.

### 6.2.3 Product Storage and Stability

- Store refrigerated at 2-8°C (36-46°F) in original carton to protect from light
- Do not freeze. Discard if product has been frozen.
- May be stored at room temperature (up to 30°C / 86°F) for up to [TBD] days for participant convenience. Once removed from refrigeration, do not return to refrigerator.
- Shelf life: [TBD] months when stored at 2-8°C
- Each pen is for single use only. Discard after use.
- Do not use if solution is discolored, cloudy, or contains visible particles.

### 6.2.4 Preparation

No reconstitution or dilution is required. The pre-filled pen is ready for use. Participants should allow the pen to reach room temperature for approximately 30 minutes prior to injection. The injection area should be cleaned with an alcohol swab. Detailed instructions for use are provided in the participant pen instruction guide.

## 6.3 Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding

**Randomization:**
- Participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio (SkeetSteph : placebo) using a centralized interactive web response system (IWRS)
- Randomization will use permuted blocks (block sizes will not be disclosed to site personnel to preserve blinding) stratified by:
  - BMI category (30-34.9 vs 35-39.9 vs ≥40 kg/m²)
  - Sex (male vs female)
  - Race/ethnicity (as defined per site demographics)
  - Glycemic status (normoglycemia [HbA1c <5.7% and FPG <100 mg/dL] vs prediabetes [HbA1c 5.7-6.4% or FPG 100-125 mg/dL])

**Blinding:**
- This is a double-blind study. The following individuals are blinded: participants, investigators, site staff, sponsor clinical team, and outcome assessors (including dermatology assessors for alopecia grading).
- An unblinded pharmacist or IWRS designee at each site will manage study drug dispensation.
- SkeetSteph and placebo pens are identical in appearance, packaging, and labeling.
- The IWRS assigns treatment and manages drug supply without revealing allocation.
- Emergency unblinding is available 24/7 through the IWRS for medical emergencies where knowledge of treatment assignment is required for participant safety. Any unblinding event must be documented and reported to the sponsor within 24 hours.
- The independent DSMB may review unblinded data per the DSMB charter.

## 6.4 Study Intervention Compliance

- Study drug compliance will be assessed at each visit by reviewing the participant injection diary and counting used/unused pens
- Compliance is defined as ≥80% of scheduled doses administered
- Site staff will address compliance barriers (injection technique issues, scheduling difficulties, side effects) through counseling and dose modification if appropriate
- Participants with compliance <80% over any 12-week period will receive enhanced adherence counseling
- Compliance data will be summarized and included in the statistical analysis plan

## 6.5 Concomitant Therapy

**Permitted Concomitant Medications:**
- All medications for pre-existing conditions that are stable for ≥30 days prior to screening (including antihypertensives, statins, antidepressants on stable dose, inhaled/topical corticosteroids, thyroid replacement, oral contraceptives)
- Over-the-counter analgesics (acetaminophen, NSAIDs) for acute symptomatic relief
- Anti-emetic medications for GI symptom management (e.g., ondansetron) at investigator discretion
- Nutritional supplements for identified deficiencies (per Section 5.3)
- Vaccinations per standard of care schedule

**Prohibited Concomitant Medications:**
- Other GLP-1 receptor agonists (semaglutide, liraglutide, dulaglutide, exenatide, tirzepatide, etc.)
- Other prescription weight loss medications (orlistat, phentermine, phentermine/topiramate, naltrexone/bupropion)
- Insulin
- Sulfonylureas
- Systemic corticosteroids >7.5 mg prednisone equivalent/day for >14 consecutive days
- Other investigational agents
- Any medication specifically prohibited due to potential drug interactions [TBD based on final drug interaction data]

All concomitant medications and changes will be documented at each study visit. Initiation of new antidiabetic, antihypertensive, or lipid-lowering medications during the study will be captured as potential intercurrent events per the estimand framework.

### 6.5.1 Rescue Medicine

Anti-emetic therapy (ondansetron 4-8 mg orally as needed, or alternative per investigator preference) is permitted for management of nausea and vomiting during the dose escalation period. Use of rescue anti-emetics will be documented and reported in the safety analysis.

If a participant develops type 2 diabetes during the study (confirmed HbA1c ≥6.5% on two occasions), the participant will be referred to their primary care provider for diabetes management. The participant may continue in the study, and initiation of antidiabetic medication (excluding prohibited medications) will be documented as an intercurrent event. Preferably, metformin would be initiated as first-line per standard of care.
