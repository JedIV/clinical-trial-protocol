# 7 STUDY INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION AND PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL

## 7.1 Discontinuation of Study Intervention

A participant may discontinue study intervention (SkeetSteph or placebo) while remaining in the study for continued follow-up assessments. Reasons for discontinuation of study intervention include:

1. **Unacceptable toxicity:**
   - Acute pancreatitis (confirmed by imaging and clinical presentation)
   - Clinically significant calcitonin elevation (≥100 pg/mL confirmed on repeat testing) or thyroid nodule suspicious for MTC on ultrasound
   - Severe hypersensitivity reaction (anaphylaxis, angioedema) to study drug
   - Persistent Grade ≥3 gastrointestinal adverse events despite dose reduction to the lowest dose level and adequate supportive care for ≥4 weeks
   - Severe alopecia meeting protocol-defined stopping criteria: SALT score >50% (loss of >50% of scalp hair) confirmed on two assessments ≥4 weeks apart, or CTCAE Grade 3 alopecia with significant psychological distress documented by the investigator
   - Hepatic injury: ALT or AST >5× ULN, or ALT or AST >3× ULN with total bilirubin >2× ULN (Hy's Law criteria)
   - Suicidal ideation with intent or plan (C-SSRS score 4 or 5) or any suicidal behavior

2. **Intercurrent illness or condition:** Development of a medical condition that contraindicates continued treatment (e.g., new diagnosis of MTC/MEN2, new diagnosis of pancreatitis, development of severe renal impairment [eGFR <15 mL/min])

3. **Pregnancy:** Positive pregnancy test at any time during the study. Study drug must be discontinued immediately. Participant enters pregnancy follow-up per Section 8.3.9.

4. **Investigator decision:** The investigator determines that continued study drug administration poses an unacceptable safety risk to the participant.

5. **Participant decision:** The participant requests to stop study drug but agrees to continue study visits and assessments.

6. **Persistent non-compliance:** Compliance <50% of scheduled doses over any 12-week period despite enhanced adherence counseling, or failure to attend ≥3 consecutive scheduled study visits.

7. **Sponsor decision:** Study termination by sponsor based on DSMB recommendation, regulatory authority action, or other safety-related considerations.

**Procedures After Study Intervention Discontinuation:**

Participants who discontinue study intervention should continue to attend all scheduled study visits per the Schedule of Activities (Section 1.3) whenever possible. This includes:
- Continued body weight measurements at all scheduled visits (primary endpoint data collection)
- Continued safety assessments including AE/SAE monitoring through the end-of-study visit (Week 80)
- Continued hair assessments at scheduled timepoints to characterize alopecia resolution/persistence
- Continued laboratory monitoring (including nutritional panel) at scheduled visits
- Continued patient-reported outcomes (IWQOL-Lite, Hairdex) at scheduled visits
- An end-of-treatment (EOT) visit should be conducted within 7 days of the last dose of study drug, including all assessments specified for the EOT visit in the SoA
- Documentation of the reason for intervention discontinuation and the date of last dose in the eCRF

Participants who discontinue study intervention early will be followed for the remainder of the 72-week treatment period and through the 8-week follow-up period, unless they withdraw consent for all study participation.

## 7.2 Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study

Complete withdrawal from the study means no further study visits, assessments, or data collection will occur.

**Criteria for Study Withdrawal:**

1. **Withdrawal of consent:** The participant voluntarily withdraws consent for all study procedures. Participants have the right to withdraw at any time without prejudice to their medical care. The investigator should make every reasonable effort to ascertain the reason for withdrawal and document it in the eCRF, but participants are not required to provide a reason.

2. **Lost to follow-up:** Unable to contact the participant despite documented contact attempts per Section 7.3.

3. **Death:** All deaths are reported as SAEs per Section 8.3.6. Date and cause of death are documented from available sources (death certificate, hospital records, autopsy report, investigator assessment).

4. **Investigator decision:** Rare circumstances where the investigator determines that continued study participation (not just study drug) is inappropriate for the participant's safety.

5. **Sponsor decision:** Study termination by the sponsor.

**Procedures for Withdrawn Participants:**

- Encourage participants to complete an early termination visit with all assessments specified for the EOT visit in the SoA
- Document the reason for withdrawal and date of last contact in the eCRF
- All data collected up to the time of withdrawal will be retained and included in analyses per the statistical analysis plan
- Withdrawn participants will not be replaced
- Participants who withdraw consent for study participation will be included in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population based on data collected prior to withdrawal
- Per the informed consent form, previously collected data may continue to be used for study analyses unless the participant specifically requests destruction of their data (to the extent permitted by applicable law)

**Partial Withdrawal Options:**

Participants may choose partial withdrawal:
- **Withdraw from study drug only:** Continue study visits and assessments (preferred option — see Section 7.1)
- **Withdraw from in-person visits:** Continue remote data collection (telephone, electronic PROs) if willing
- **Complete withdrawal:** No further contact or data collection

The investigator should clearly discuss these options with any participant considering withdrawal and document the participant's preference.

## 7.3 Lost to Follow-Up

**Definition:** A participant is considered lost to follow-up (LTFU) when they fail to attend scheduled study visits and cannot be contacted despite documented attempts using all available methods.

**Contact Attempt Procedures:**

A minimum of 3 documented contact attempts using at least 2 different methods must be made over a period of at least 4 weeks before a participant is classified as LTFU:

1. **Telephone contact:** At least 2 calls at different times of day (morning and evening) on different days of the week. Leave voicemail messages if possible.
2. **Written communication:** One certified letter (or equivalent trackable mail) sent to the participant's last known address.
3. **Electronic communication:** Email and/or text message (if participant has consented to electronic contact).
4. **Emergency contact:** Contact the emergency contact person listed in the participant's study file (per signed consent).
5. **Medical records review:** Check institutional medical records for recent healthcare encounters.

**Documentation:** Each contact attempt must be documented in the study source documents with: date, time, method used, person making the attempt, and outcome.

**Classification:** If all contact attempts are exhausted without successful contact, the participant is classified as LTFU. The date of the last successful contact is recorded as the date of withdrawal from the study.

**Analysis:** LTFU participants are included in the ITT population. Data collected up to the last contact are used in analyses. Missing data after LTFU are handled per the multiple imputation methodology specified in the statistical analysis plan (Section 9).

# 8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES

## 8.1 Efficacy Assessments

### Primary Efficacy Assessment: Body Weight

Body weight is the primary efficacy measure for this study. Accurate and consistent weight measurement is critical.

**Measurement Procedures:**
- Body weight measured at every scheduled visit (Screening through Week 80) as specified in the SoA
- Calibrated digital scale used at each site; scale must be calibrated per manufacturer instructions and documented at least quarterly
- Same scale should be used for a given participant throughout the study whenever possible
- Measurements taken in light indoor clothing (no shoes, coats, heavy accessories)
- Fasting preferred (≥8 hours) for consistency; fasting status documented
- Measured at approximately the same time of day when possible
- Weight recorded to the nearest 0.1 kg
- If the first measurement appears inconsistent with prior measurements (>2 kg change from last visit for visits <4 weeks apart), a second measurement should be taken and both recorded

**Primary Endpoint Derivation:**
- Percent change from baseline: ((Weight at Week 72 - Weight at Baseline) / Weight at Baseline) × 100
- Baseline weight defined as the Day 1 (randomization) body weight measurement
- Co-primary endpoint: Binary response (≥5% weight reduction from baseline at Week 72: Yes/No)

### Secondary Efficacy Assessments

**Responder Analyses:**
- Proportion achieving ≥10% weight reduction at Week 72
- Proportion achieving ≥15% weight reduction at Week 72
- Assessed using the same weight measurements as the primary endpoint

**Waist Circumference:**
- Measured at Baseline, Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 80 (per SoA)
- Measured at the midpoint between the lowest palpable rib and the iliac crest, at the end of normal expiration, using a non-stretchable tape measure
- Recorded to the nearest 0.1 cm
- Two measurements taken; if they differ by >1 cm, a third measurement is taken and the median value is recorded

**Cardiometabolic Parameters:**
- Systolic and diastolic blood pressure: Triplicate measurements after 5 minutes seated rest, recorded at every visit. Mean of 3 readings used for analysis.
- Fasting plasma glucose: Measured at every visit during dose escalation; every 12 weeks during maintenance
- HbA1c: Measured at Screening, Baseline, Weeks 24, 48, and 72
- Fasting lipid panel (total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides): Measured at Screening, Baseline, Weeks 24, 48, and 72

**Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs):**

| Instrument | Description | Timepoints |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **IWQOL-Lite** (Impact of Weight on Quality of Life - Lite) | 31-item weight-specific QoL measure assessing physical function, self-esteem, sexual life, public distress, and work. Total score 0-100 (higher = better). | Baseline, Weeks 24, 48, 72 |
| **SF-36** (Short Form 36 Health Survey) | Generic health-related QoL measure with 8 domains and 2 composite scores (Physical Component Summary, Mental Component Summary). | Baseline, Weeks 48, 72 |
| **EQ-5D-5L** | Generic health utility measure for health economic analyses. 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) with visual analogue scale. | Baseline, Weeks 24, 48, 72 |
| **Hairdex** | Hair-specific quality of life questionnaire assessing emotional, functional, and social impact of hair problems. | Baseline, Weeks 24, 48, 72, 80 |

PRO assessments should be completed by the participant at the beginning of the study visit, before any clinical assessments or discussions with study staff, to minimize bias.

### Exploratory Efficacy Assessments

**DXA Body Composition (Substudy, ~500 participants):**
- Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) whole-body scan at Baseline and Week 72
- Performed at substudy-qualified sites with standardized DXA equipment (Hologic or GE Lunar)
- Measures: Total body fat mass, lean body mass, bone mineral content, percentage body fat, regional fat distribution (android/gynoid ratio)
- All DXA scans read by a central imaging core laboratory for consistency
- Participants provide separate consent for DXA substudy

## 8.2 Safety and Other Assessments

### Physical Examination
- **Complete physical examination:** Screening, Baseline, and Week 72 (EOT). Includes examination of all major body systems: general appearance, HEENT, cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, musculoskeletal, neurological, skin (including scalp), and lymph nodes.
- **Directed physical examination:** All other scheduled visits. Focused on any new or worsening symptoms, AE-related findings, and assessment relevant to the study intervention (GI system, injection sites, scalp/hair).

### Vital Signs
Measured at every study visit:
- Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (triplicate, seated, after 5 min rest)
- Pulse/heart rate
- Respiratory rate
- Body temperature (oral)
- Orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate at Screening only (supine to standing after 3 minutes)

### Hair and Alopecia Assessments (Adverse Event of Special Interest)

Given the identified alopecia safety signal with the GLP-1 RA class, this protocol includes comprehensive, prospective hair assessments:

**Hair Density Assessment (Trichoscopy):**
- Performed by a trained dermatology assessor (or site staff trained per protocol-specific training module)
- Trichoscopy of standardized scalp regions (vertex, frontal, temporal) using dermoscopic imaging device
- Hair density (hairs/cm²), hair diameter, and vellus-to-terminal hair ratio documented
- Standardized hair pull test: gentle traction on 50-60 hairs from 3 scalp regions; >10% extracted hairs is positive (suggestive of active telogen effluvium)
- Timepoints: Baseline, Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 80

**Standardized Scalp Photography:**
- Global photographs: 4 standardized views (vertex, frontal hairline, right temporal, left temporal) using a reproducible positioning device
- Photographs taken under consistent lighting conditions with color calibration card
- All photographs reviewed by central dermatology reader for blinded assessment of hair loss progression/resolution
- Timepoints: Baseline, Weeks 24, 48, 72, and 80

**Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) Score:**
- Quantitative assessment of percentage of scalp affected by hair loss
- Score 0-100 (0 = no hair loss, 100 = complete scalp hair loss)
- Calculated by trained assessor at each scheduled hair assessment visit
- Used for alopecia severity grading and stopping rule assessment
- Timepoints: Baseline, Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 80

**CTCAE v5.0 Alopecia Grading:**
- Grade 1: Hair loss of <50% of normal that is not obvious from a distance but only on close inspection; a different hairstyle may be required to cover the hair loss but it does not require a wig or hairpiece
- Grade 2: Hair loss of ≥50% normal that is readily apparent to others; a wig or hairpiece is necessary to completely camouflage
- Grade 3: Not defined for alopecia in CTCAE v5.0; for this protocol, Grade 3 is defined as SALT score >75% with significant psychological impact requiring referral for psychological support

**Alopecia AESI Reporting:**
- Any new-onset alopecia or worsening of pre-existing subclinical hair thinning is reported as an AESI
- AESI report includes: date of onset, CTCAE grade, SALT score, hair pull test result, nutritional biomarker values at most recent assessment, associated symptoms (scalp pruritus, tenderness), hair loss pattern (diffuse, patterned, patchy), rate of weight loss at time of onset
- All alopecia AESIs reviewed by the sponsor's dermatology safety consultant within 5 business days

### Laboratory Assessments

- Timepoints: Screening, Baseline, Weeks 12, 24, 48, 72

**Pancreatic Enzymes (Amylase and Lipase):**
- Monitored for pancreatitis risk per GLP-1 RA class labeling
- Elevation >3× ULN triggers enhanced monitoring; elevation >5× ULN with compatible symptoms triggers study drug hold and clinical evaluation per Section 7.1
- Timepoints: Screening, Baseline, and every visit through Week 72

**Calcitonin:**
- Monitored for thyroid C-cell tumor risk per GLP-1 RA class labeling
- Calcitonin ≥100 pg/mL on confirmed repeat testing triggers thyroid ultrasound and referral to endocrinologist
- Timepoints: Screening, Baseline, Weeks 24, 48, 72

**Thyroid Function (TSH, free T4):**
- Screening, Weeks 24, 72
- Abnormalities evaluated and managed per standard of care

**Nutritional Panel (ferritin, serum iron, TIBC, zinc, biotin, vitamin D [25-OH], vitamin B12, folate):**

**Urinalysis:**
- Screening and Week 72

### 12-Lead ECG
- Standard 12-lead ECG performed at Screening, Baseline, Week 24, and Week 72
- ECG reviewed locally by the investigator and centrally by an independent cardiologist (central ECG core laboratory)
- QTcF interval calculated using Fridericia correction
- QTcF >500 msec or increase from baseline >60 msec triggers enhanced cardiac monitoring and clinical evaluation

### Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)
- Baseline version administered at Screening and Baseline
- Since-last-visit version administered at Weeks 12, 24, 48, and 72
- Any positive response for suicidal ideation with intent (Type 4), suicidal ideation with plan (Type 5), or any suicidal behavior triggers immediate psychiatric evaluation, study drug discontinuation per Section 7.1, and SAE reporting

## 8.3 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events

### 8.3.1 Definition of Adverse Events (AE)

An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial participant administered a study intervention and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention.

This includes:
- Any new condition or worsening of a pre-existing condition
- Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values or diagnostic test results
- Events resulting from protocol-mandated interventions (e.g., blood draws)
- Pre-existing conditions that worsen in severity or frequency during the study

This does NOT include:
- Medical or surgical procedures (the condition leading to the procedure is the AE)
- Situations where no untoward medical occurrence has occurred (e.g., hospitalization for elective surgery planned before study entry)
- Disease progression or worsening of the condition under study (unless unexpected in nature or severity)

### 8.3.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAE)

An SAE is any AE that:
- Results in death
- Is life-threatening (places the participant at immediate risk of death at the time of the event)
- Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
- Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity
- Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect
- Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above

**Note:** Planned hospitalizations for study procedures or pre-existing conditions (planned before study entry) are not SAEs unless the condition worsens unexpectedly.

### 8.3.3 Classification of an Adverse Event

Each AE must be classified by the investigator for:

**Severity (CTCAE v5.0):**
- Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated
- Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental ADL
- Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation indicated; disabling; limiting self-care ADL
- Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated
- Grade 5: Death related to AE

**Relationship to Study Intervention (Investigator Assessment):**
- Not related: No reasonable possibility that the study intervention caused the AE
- Possibly related: There is a reasonable possibility that the study intervention caused the AE (temporal relationship and/or biological plausibility, but alternative explanations exist)
- Probably related: Strong temporal relationship and biological plausibility; unlikely to be explained by another cause
- Definitely related: Clear temporal relationship, confirmed by rechallenge or dechallenge, no other plausible explanation

**Outcome:**
- Recovered/Resolved
- Recovering/Resolving
- Not recovered/Not resolved
- Recovered/Resolved with sequelae
- Fatal
- Unknown

**Action Taken with Study Intervention:**
- None
- Dose reduced
- Drug interrupted (temporarily held)
- Drug withdrawn (permanently discontinued)
- Not applicable

### 8.3.4 Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow-Up

**AE Collection Period:**
- AE collection begins at the time of informed consent (for procedure-related AEs) or at the time of first dose of study intervention (for treatment-emergent AEs)
- AEs are collected continuously through the end-of-study visit (Week 80)
- SAEs are collected from the time of informed consent through 30 days after the last dose of study intervention, or through the end-of-study visit, whichever is later

**Assessment Frequency:**
- AEs assessed at every study visit by open-ended questioning ("Have you experienced any new symptoms or changes in your health since your last visit?")
- Between visits: Participants instructed to contact the study site for any new or worsening symptoms
- AE assessment includes review of concomitant medications, laboratory results, vital signs, physical examination findings, and participant reports

**Follow-Up:**
- All AEs followed to resolution, stabilization, return to baseline, or determination that the event is chronic/irreversible
- SAEs followed until resolution regardless of timing relative to study visits
- Alopecia AESIs followed through the end-of-study visit (Week 80) and beyond if not resolved, with extended follow-up per sponsor agreement

### 8.3.5 Adverse Event Reporting

- All AEs recorded in the eCRF with: verbatim term (MedDRA coding applied by data management), onset date, resolution date (or ongoing), severity grade (CTCAE v5.0), seriousness criteria (if SAE), relationship to study intervention, action taken, outcome, and concomitant treatment administered
- AEs coded using MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities), latest version available at database lock

### 8.3.6 Serious Adverse Event Reporting

- All SAEs must be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of the investigator becoming aware of the event
- SAEs reported via the electronic SAE reporting system provided by the sponsor
- Initial report: Complete SAE form with all available information within 24 hours
- Follow-up reports: Submit updated information as it becomes available within 5 calendar days
- The sponsor will report all applicable SAEs to the FDA per 21 CFR 312.32 (IND safety reports) within the required timeframes:
  - Unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reactions: 7 calendar days
  - All other reportable SAEs: 15 calendar days
- The sponsor will distribute IND safety reports to all participating investigators and relevant IRBs

### 8.3.7 Reporting Events to Participants

If the DSMB or sponsor identifies a safety signal that may affect the risk-benefit assessment for enrolled participants, the following actions will be taken:
- Updated risk information communicated to all participating investigators
- IRBs notified per regulatory requirements
- Informed consent form revised if needed
- Enrolled participants re-consented with updated risk information if the safety signal materially changes the risk-benefit profile
- Decision to continue, modify, or terminate the study made in consultation with the DSMB

### 8.3.8 Events of Special Interest

The following are designated as Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) for this study and require enhanced data collection and expedited reporting to the sponsor within 72 hours:

1. **Alopecia** (any grade): New-onset hair loss or worsening of pre-existing subclinical hair thinning. Enhanced data collection includes SALT score, CTCAE grade, hair pull test result, photographic documentation, nutritional biomarker values, and patient-reported hair impact (Hairdex).

- Any pregnancy complication or adverse outcome reported as an AE or SAE as appropriate
- Male participants whose partners become pregnant: Pregnancy outcome followed and reported to the sponsor
- Participants should contact the study site immediately if they suspect pregnancy

## 8.4 Unanticipated Problems

### 8.4.1 Definition of Unanticipated Problems (UP)

An unanticipated problem (UP) is any incident, experience, or outcome that meets ALL THREE of the following criteria:
1. **Unexpected** (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given the procedures described in the protocol, the known characteristics of the study intervention, and the characteristics of the study population
2. **Related or possibly related** to participation in the research
3. **Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm** (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized

### 8.4.2 Unanticipated Problem Reporting

- UPs reported to the IRB and the sponsor within the timeframes specified by the reviewing IRB (typically within 5-10 business days of the investigator becoming aware of the event)
- For federally funded research: UPs involving risks to participants or others reported to OHRP per 45 CFR 46.108(a)(4) and 46.103(b)(5)
- UPs reported to the FDA as appropriate per 21 CFR 312.32
- UP reports include: description of the event, assessment of expectedness, assessment of relatedness to the research, assessment of increased risk, corrective actions taken or proposed

### 8.4.3 Reporting Unanticipated Problems to Participants

If an UP is identified that may affect the safety or willingness of current participants to continue in the study:
- Participants are informed of the new information in a timely manner
- Informed consent form revised to reflect the new information
- Participants are re-consented with updated consent form
- Participants given the opportunity to withdraw from the study based on new information
